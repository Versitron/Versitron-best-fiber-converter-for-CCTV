## Best Fiber Converter for CCTV

**Choose a fiber converter that ensures high-quality, long-distance video transport for CCTV systems.**

- Converts CCTV or network camera signals from copper to fiber for extended runs  
- Provides immunity to EMI, surges, and electrical noise — critical for security deployments  
- Maintains video integrity with minimal latency and high uptime  
- Ideal for campuses, warehouses, transit hubs, and multi-building CCTV networks  

A Versitron fiber converter offers dependable performance for critical video surveillance infrastructure.

## Can I Convert RJ45 to Fiber?

**Yes — RJ45 (Ethernet) to fiber conversion is possible using the right fiber media converters or switches.**

- Media converters accept Ethernet over RJ45 and convert it to fiber-optic signals  
- Enables connection from copper-based network devices to fiber backbones  
- Great for extending network segments, IP cameras, access control systems, and security infrastructure  
- Provides electrical isolation and extended range beyond copper limitations  

Using a fiber media converter or industrial fiber switch, you can bridge RJ45 network devices into a fiber network.

## How to Run Fiber to Security Cameras

**Best practices for deploying fiber to CCTV and network cameras:**

1. **Choose the right fiber type** – Single-mode for long distances; multimode for shorter runs.  
2. **Use appropriate converters or switches** – Connect fiber to cameras via fiber media converters or fiber-enabled PoE switches.  
3. **Plan your cable route** – Avoid sharp bends, high-interference zones, and areas with potential physical damage.  
4. **Terminate and test properly** – Use quality connectors (SC, LC) and test continuity and signal before commissioning.  
5. **Protect infrastructure** – Use conduits, patch panels, and weatherproof enclosures in outdoor or industrial areas.  

Fiber optics allow security cameras to communicate over longer distances with high reliability and zero signal loss.

## Does PoE Work with Media Converters?

**PoE (Power over Ethernet) can work with media converters — but only with the right type.**

- **Standard media converters:** Convert Ethernet to fiber but *do not* pass PoE power  
- **PoE-capable fiber converters or PoE switches:** Provide both data and power over copper RJ45 and then extend data over fiber  
- For powering cameras, use PoE fiber switches or PoE+ converters so cameras receive power while data travels over fiber  

To support PoE, choose a media converter or switch designed specifically for PoE applications.
